This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with specific device configurations. The camera preview freezes or becomes unresponsive after a certain period of time, or after certain actions (e.g., taking a picture or switching cameras).  The error doesn't always produce a clear error message in the console, making debugging difficult.  It seems to be related to memory management or resource contention on the device.
