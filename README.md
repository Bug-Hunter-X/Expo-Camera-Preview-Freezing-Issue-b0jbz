# Expo Camera Preview Freezing Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API.  The camera preview intermittently freezes on certain devices, without providing a clear error message in the console.  The suspected cause is a memory management or resource contention problem. 

The `cameraBug.js` file reproduces the issue.  The `cameraBugSolution.js` provides a potential workaround (see below for details).

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install`
3. Run the app using Expo Go or EAS Build.

## Solution

The provided solution in `cameraBugSolution.js` involves more aggressive memory management. The primary change is the introduction of a mechanism that explicitly releases camera resources when the component unmounts and introduces error handling for better debugging. While this isn't a perfect solution, it mitigated the issue in our testing.
